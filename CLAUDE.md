# tfwatch — Claude Code Configuration

Read and follow these files for every session:
- `prompts/CONTEXT.md` — project context, conventions, file ownership boundaries
- `prompts/GUARDRAILS.md` — AI safety rules and hard boundaries

Agent personas are defined in `prompts/agents/`. Slash commands in `.claude/commands/` load these personas. See `AGENTS.md` for full usage guide.
